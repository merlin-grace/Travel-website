##Introduction

A travel website serves as an information hub for prospective travelers planning a getaway. 

Today, people travel for a range of experiencesâ€”babymoons, staycations, voluntourism or bleisure and so on.

So, Travel Websites provide as much relevant information as possible to help users plan their trips.

Setup:
- run ```i &&npm start ``` for both client and server side to start the development server.
